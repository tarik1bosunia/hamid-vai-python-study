# Day 1: Introduction & Setup

### 🐍 What is Python? Why use it?

* **Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
* Known for being **easy to learn, readable, and versatile**.
* Used in:

  * Web development
  * Data Science & AI/ML
  * Bioinformatics
  * Automation & Scripting

**Why Python?**

* Simple syntax, close to English.
* Large community and library support.
* Cross-platform (works on Windows, Mac, Linux).

### 💻 Google Colab Basics

Google Colab = Online Jupyter Notebook provided by Google.

* **Cells**: Two types → Code cells (for Python) & Text/Markdown cells (for explanations).
* **Runtime**: A virtual computer provided by Google.
* **Saving files**: Automatically saved in Google Drive.

👉 Good for beginners (no installation needed).

### 👩‍💻 First Program in Python

```python
# My first Python program
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```

✅ `print()` is used to display output.
✅ Strings must be inside quotes (`' '` or `" "`).

### ✍️ Comments in Python

Comments = Notes inside your code (ignored by Python).

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

---

### 📦 Variables

Variables = containers to store values.

```python
# Assigning values
name = "Alice"
age = 20
pi = 3.1416

# Printing variables
print(name)
print(age)
print(pi)
```

**Output:**

```
Alice
20
3.1416
```

👉 Python automatically detects types (`str`, `int`, `float`).
👉 Variable names should be **descriptive** and follow snake_case (`my_variable`).

### 📝 Practice Tasks (Day 1)

1. Write a program that prints your name and age.
2. Store your favorite number in a variable and print it.
3. Add two numbers and print the result.
4. Use comments to explain your code.
